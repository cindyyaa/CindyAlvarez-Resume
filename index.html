        <p class="lead mb-4">My professional experience is limited which is why I am looking to further my professional experience. I have been involved in clubs and community service such as Key Club International where I attended meetings where they discussed the community service opportunities, made stockings for a stockings drive during the holidays, and went around the school and put up kind notes for happiness week. I was also an AVID Peer Tutor where I went to a classroom twice a week to help students with assignments. AVID members would present a problem in a subject with a question and I would guide them to their answer by solving an example problem or asking them questions. I also mentored them to solve the problem so that they would develop the knowledge. I was in an AVID program where the focus was college, community service, and helping students in their other classes. The program helped me gain a deeper understanding of college and career interests. We also did weekly tutorials where we would get help in the subject that was challenging for that week. <br><br>

        A community service event I went to was the Canyon Crest Elementary Math Night where I prepared math games which helped students learn how to do math while having fun. This taught them how to play math games because they needed to solve math problems in order to win and I assisted after school event 30+ hours. Another even was the Canyon Crest Pro Movie Nights where I brought out cones in order to establish a line as well as decorated. I also placed the screen for the movie to be projected on and made sure that it did not fall while cleaning up by sweeping up the food off the ground and putting away the cones. The same elementary school also held a STEMtastic Day in which I volunteered for where I spearheaded organization by arranging tables and decorated them by adding tablecloths on them and confetti. I assembled balloons where they represented types of energy such as potential and kinetic energy that I explained. The balloons were given away and later cleaned up by putting things away such as tables. <br><br>

        I earned a high school diploma after completing all the requirements to graduate. After that, I am now attending the University of California, Riverside. This is where I am taking courses in order to learn more about my major in pre-business where I will later apply to the School of Business and major in Business Administration where I will later have to also choose a concentration. Another way I will further my professional experience is by taking courses necessary for business administration and joining clubs that will help me to gain knowledge and a better understanding of the business world. For instance, I have already taken the intro to business course which helped me better understand the aspects of it and I even had to complete a group project which taught me how to work with a team.
